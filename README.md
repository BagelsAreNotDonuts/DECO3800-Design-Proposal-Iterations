# Overview

Throughout the semester my team was tasked with finding a problemspace to design a digital solution for, after doing individual research on respective topics that interested us, then pitching them to one another in a meeting, we eventually landed on the problemspace: Sleep deprivation in university students.

From then on we followed an iterative process, going through various stages of design, feedback and restructring to come up with the system we submitted during our deadline.
